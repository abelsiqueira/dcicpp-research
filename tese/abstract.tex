One way to solve general nonlinear programming problems is the composite-step
strategies.  These strategies usually combine a step tangent to the constraints
and a normal step, alternating between reducing the objective function value and
the norm of the infeasibility.  This kind of method requires the control of the
steps or the iterates, in order to prevent one step from destroying
the progress of another. We will present an extension of the Dynamic Control of
Infeasibility method, which utilizes a strategy to control the steps known as
Trust Cylinders. This method was originally designed for problems with equality
contraints
only, and our extension will handle general constraints. We'll show numerical
experiments comparing our method with another composite-step method.
